                            Hi, my name is Kenneth, and I'm a UCI graduate. I majored in Computer Game Science. I have worked at the University of California, Los Angeles
                            as a software developer since 2021. Making sure that I understand is important, and I will ask to help me help others, from the stakeholder to colleagues. 
                            A solution for the users that assists and maintains is what I strive for. I also love listening to music and learning about the history of pop music, 
                            so I make sure I listen to what's popular to see how culture and tastes change and how I adapt with the changing climate.  
                        </p>
                    </div>
